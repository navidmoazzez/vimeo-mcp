/**
 * Decides whether a write is allowed to reach Vimeo.
 *
 * The hazard on this platform is narrower than on a social network but sharper.
 * Deleting a video removes the source file and every embed of it across every
 * site that has one, and Vimeo does not keep a copy to restore from. A deleted
 * showcase takes its ordering and its custom branding with it.
 *
 * Everything else here is cheap to undo. Moving videos between folders, adding
 * a video to a showcase, editing a title, retagging: all one call back.
 *
 * So the guard sits on the six deletes and nowhere else. Putting `confirm` on a
 * bulk folder move would be worse than useless, because that tool exists to be
 * called in a loop and the model would learn to pass confirm without reading.
